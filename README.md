Hi there 👋, I'm Rishik Durvasula

💻 Software Engineer | 🧠 AI Enthusiast | 📱 iOS Dev | 🌱 Data Explorer

I’m a UCLA student majoring in Linguistics & Computer Science with a Data Science minor, passionate about building intelligent, scalable, and meaningful software systems that bridge performance with purpose. Whether it’s training neural nets on GPU clusters, deploying full-stack web apps, or engineering classification SDKs in C++, I love solving complex problems through clean, elegant code.

## 🛠 What I Do
🔸 Software Engineering:
Skilled in C++, Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, Swift, Python, and more. I’ve engineered everything from real-time iOS apps to optimized data SDKs using frameworks like React, Node.js, Flask, and Express.

🔸 Machine Learning & Deep Learning:
Built AI systems using scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and GNNs to drive real-world impact—from predicting molecular properties to decoding neural activity in brain imaging.

🔸 Full-Stack Development:
Crafted intuitive, data-driven applications using MongoDB, AWS, Docker, and SQL. I combine frontend finesse with backend power, whether it’s through REST APIs or scalable databases.

🔸 DevOps & Systems Engineering:
From containerization with Docker to CI/CD with CMake and gRPC integrations, I focus on making software faster, more reliable, and easier to ship.

🔸 Leadership & Mentorship:
As Backend Director at AgeWell Bruins, I lead a growing team of developers in designing health-tech solutions for older adults, merging empathy with engineering.

## 🚀 What I’m Working On
🔸 FindMyFood (iOS App Launching Soon):
A SwiftUI-based social networking app for foodies, backed by Node.js, Express, and AWS. Think Yelp meets social media.

🔸 Neural Imaging Analysis at Golshani Lab:
Deploying deep learning models (Cellpose, CNNs) for neuron detection, enabling high-precision research in brain science.

🔸 AI Grocery Assistant:
Creating a tool to better assist college students to optimize grocery shopping
